# Eco-KGML Inclusion and Diversity Statement

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience to everyone. This statement was developed with the goal of affirming our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and is grounded in our group’s commitment to everyone’s personal and scientific growth and development. This is a living document that we can and will revisit.

Safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by both 1) day-to-day interactions we all have with each other and 2) ensuring that DEI is embedded in the group’s longer-term strategic decisions. It is the responsibility of all members of our group to work together to create and maintain a safe, inclusive, harassment-free environment for all.

## Action Plan

We are actively working to promote greater inclusivity in our group, the communities in which we live, and freshwater science as a discipline by:

* Holding each other accountable to a group code of conduct: we co-created the code of conduct to ensure everyone has a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience in our community

* Leading regular conversations on DEI topics

* Developing anti-racist frameworks for: our community interactions (via our code of conduct); recruiting and mentoring students; and safely conducting fieldwork

* Conducting translational science: we work closely with managers and community members to co-develop scientific studies and conduct research to ensure that our findings are usable and accessible to the communities we live in

* Communicating our science: we partner with educators, outreach coordinators, and managers to translate our research, solicit feedback, and ensure that our findings are broadly shared and accessible to the public

* Promoting best practices of open science: to enable greater participation in freshwater science, we use and develop open-source software, publish all of our data shortly after collection, and are constantly evolving lab practices to ensure accessibility and reproducibility of our data and analyses

* Teaching as research: we develop, assess, and disseminate hands-on, active learning teaching materials, which reduce the achievement gap of students in STEM. We use assessment data to constantly revise our teaching modules and methods to improve their accessibility for a wide range of students
